In January 2022 Microsoft introduced an enhanced version of it's CSP program. The changes were enforced by Microsoft to all it's partners, which meant that these
changes had to be adopted by SoftwareONE. Changes impacted the partner portal 'ONEClub' in terms of how partners purchased, cancelled and managed their software subscriptions.
Being the UX Product Designer for ONEClub it was my responsibility to work with the business and partners to re-design the portal in order to introduce these changes while providing an enhanced
user experience.

                        I attended a number of early fact finding meetings with key stakeholders within the business in order to determine what the requirements 
                        for the proejct would be for UX. I met with the business owner of the product as well as the PM and also Business Development Managers. During weekly planning meetings
                        for the product development teams were also involved in the discussions. It became clear that delivering on the project would be the top priority for the team. The requirements were discussed
                        and it was decided that the implementations would be carried out in stages according to priority and timelines. <P>

                        I also spoke to partners during monthly recurring customer preview calls. The feedback from partners was that they wanted the new functionality being 
                        introduced by Microsoft and they felt that their customers would also demand these enhancements. Speaking to development managers from within the business 
                        they gave me the same feedback from customers. So both the business and our customers were aligned that these changes were needed and a top priority.

	 As part of the New Commercial Experience Microsoft introduced an additional purchasing option that had to be brought into the portal. Up to this point there were two purchasing 
   options 1) Monthly Billing with a Monthly Commitmentand 2) Yearly Billing with an Annual Commitment. The New Commerce Experience <b>added a third option - an Annual Commitment Term with a Monthly Billing option.</b>
   Reviewing the portal it became clear that <b>the purchasing cards in use would not be suitable for this additional third buying option.</b> This lead to a re-design of the product list and product detail pages.

 The existing product card design showed two purchasing options on the card in the product list view. The user could pick from one of these options and then add to cart immediately. 
 This design could not be scaled to include a third buying option so a re-design of the product card was needed.

                            I like to start the prototyping stage by creating paper prototypes
                             until I think I have some designs that could fit the problem. 
                             This can be helpful to ideate in this form initially in order to 
                             gain some clarity of the user flow and also how the UI would need to be changed.
                             It can save time in the long run as it is easier to redraw a paper prototype than 
                             to change a high fidelity mockup.

                  The intention was to validate the new design and to also obtain Quantitative data that backed up the Qualitative feedback from 
                  users during the UAT sessions of the new purchasing cards. The analysis was run for a 6 month period, following on from the

                                The legacy card funnel had a conversion rate of 84%, with the highest drop-off happening in step 1 - the add to cart step.
                                Some users were adding to cart from the product list card but then not moving into the shopping cart to complete the buying journey.
                                A separate piece of analysis and design was undertaken to re-design the mini-cart which can be viewed {LINK TO CART UX IMPROVEMENT} in my portfolio.

                    2.2 - Upgrades (Subscription Detail)</h3>
                  <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
                   Another important change that Microsoft introduced was the abililty to provide
                      mid-term upgrades options to higher products. 
                       Partial and full upgrades were possible, including the option of changing commitment term and billing cycle.
                   This offering had to be designed and implemented into the portal.</p>


                   <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
                    <b> Sketch prototypes were created and a number of designs were tested with participants from within the company</b>. In total I conducted 9  
                    remote moderated usability tests and this lead to the final 
                 proposed design that was assigned to the development team. 
                 During the UAT of the design a number of other improvements were made to the subscription detail page including 
                 introducing a commitment term onto the detail page and updating the cancellation button. </p>

                                  <b>Usability:</b> The label was changed on the primary button to 'View Upgrade Options' as users felt that 'Upgrade Now' would automatically 
                                  perform an upgrade action. This button actually opens a side panel of possible upgrades for this subscription, and the upgrade is 
                                  performed later in the user flow.

                                 <B>Proximity:</B> The placement of the upgrade button was also moved to be above the quantity increase/decrease function and some padding was introduced as 
                                  upgrades are a separate action and not related to this function, so should not be grouped together. Some users were going to change quantities before upgrading.

                     read documentation available on material.io. I created a new component for the design system based on this and also worked with the UI Designer to 
                     create guidelines
                    for its use, so that other designers in the team could reference this. </p>

                                  Another change to licensing that was imposed as part of NCE was the time period allowed for reduction of subscription quantities.
                                The new business rules meant that there was a 7 day window where the partner could reduce quantities of the subscription. 
                                Also whenever the partner increased the quantity of a subscription they received an additional 7 day window where they could 
                      make a reduction to that specific quantity if needed.
                                Outside of this 
                              they would have to wait until the subscription renewed again before they would be able to reduce the quantity or alternatively they could use the 
                            new tool introduced to schedule a change to the quantity of the subscription at renewal.

                      Partners needed a way of being able to track how many licenses attached to a subscription could be reduced, and what the time frames were 
                      for these possible reductions. This additional functionality was also designed , tested and deployed in the portal.

                                       A side panel component was used again, that would open from the right of the screen when the user clicked on the 
                                       'Check Licenses to Reduce' button. There was a change to the copy shown to the partner to advise them of this additional functionality.
                                      The same dropdown components were used in the design, the main difference being the API calls from the backend database would be changed 
                                    as this feature is distinct from the upgrades tool.</p>

                                      <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
                                Before I could schedule UAT tests with users to test the usability of the new commerce features I needed to ensure that the 
                                complex business logic and functionality were correct. I scheduled calls with the front-end QA and development team to test the user journeys.
                                During the testing we discovered a number of issues such as back-end dependencies with the data not updating correctly following on from a task such as an 
                                upgrade or adjustment of subscription quantity. Also there were front-end corrections that needed to be made where the logic of the implementation or the UI of the 
                                features was not correct. 
                    
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
                              Once these issues were corrected I again reviewed the implementation with the team and then gave the go-ahead for the partial release into produciton on a test account.
                              It was important to test again in production using a test account to ensure that correct pricing was being applied, there were limitations in development where dummy pricing data was being used.
