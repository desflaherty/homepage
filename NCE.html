In January 2022 Microsoft introduced an enhanced version of it's CSP program. The changes were enforced by Microsoft to all it's partners, which meant that these
changes had to be adopted by SoftwareONE. Changes impacted the partner portal 'ONEClub' in terms of how partners purchased, cancelled and managed their software subscriptions for 365 products, namely
Office 365, Microsoft 365, Windows 365 and Dynamics 365.
Being the UX Product Designer for ONEClub it was my responsibility to work with the business and partners to re-design the portal in order to introduce these changes while providing an enhanced
user experience.

This project involved numerous meetings and discussions with key stakeholders and development teams working to a time sensitive deadline.
 The project was undertaken from February-October 2022, implemented in stages, in conjunction with the various daily responsibilities and workload of my role.
 The first part of the project involved re-designing the existing buying cards to introduce a third purchasing option. Later stages involved 
 adding additional functionality to the subscription detail and list view to include the new commerce model.

                        I attended a number of early fact finding meetings with key stakeholders within the business in order to determine what the requirements 
                        for the proejct would be for UX. I met with the business owner of the product as well as the PM and also Business Development Managers. During weekly planning meetings
                        for the product development teams were also involved in the discussions. It became clear that delivering on the project would be the top priority for the team. The requirements were discussed
                        and it was decided that the implementations would be carried out in stages according to priority and timelines. <P>

                        I also spoke to partners during monthly recurring customer preview calls. The feedback from partners was that they wanted the new functionality being 
                        introduced by Microsoft and they felt that their customers would also demand these enhancements. Speaking to stakeholders from within the business 
                        they gave me the same feedback from customers. So both the business and our customers were aligned that these changes were needed and a top priority.

	 As part of the New Commercial Experience Microsoft introduced an additional purchasing option that had to be brought into the portal. Up to this point there were two purchasing 
   options 1) Annual Commitment with Annual Billing and 2) Annual Commitment with Monthly Billing cycle. The New Commerce Experience added a third option - a Monthly Commitment Term with a Monthly Billing cycle.
   Reviewing the portal it became clear that <b>the purchasing cards in use would not be suitable for this additional third buying option.</b> This lead to a re-design of the product list and product detail pages.

 The existing product card design showed two purchasing options on the card in the product list view. The user could pick from one of these options and then add to cart immediately. 
 This design could not be scaled to include a third buying option so a re-design of the product card was needed.

                            I like to start the prototyping stage by creating paper prototypes
                             until I think I have some designs that could fit the problem. 
                             This can be helpful to ideate in this form initially in order to 
                             gain some clarity of the user flow and also how the UI would need to be changed.
                             It can save time in the long run as it is easier to redraw a paper prototype than 
                             to change a high fidelity mockup.

                 It was important to analyse user adoption of the new buying cards in the product list/catalogue as well as in the product detail.
                  Heap Analytics was used for this data analysis.
                  New events were defined in Heap and used to count engagement with the new NCE product cards in the product list page. The clicks
                  on the 'View all buying options' button on the NCE card were obtained. When the user clicks on this button they are taken to the product detail page.
                  The engagement on the new NCE product options were defined in an event along with the clicks on the 'Buy Now' or 'Add to Cart' buttons on this page.
                  The conversion was measured between these steps and from there the conversion to the shopping cart page was also included.

                  <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
                  The intention was to validate the new design and to also obtain quantitative data that backed up the qualitative feedback from 
                  users during the UAT sessions of the new purchasing cards. The analysis was run for a 6 month period, following on from the 
                  deployment of the new cards to production in March 2022.

                                                    Some users were moving into the product detail but they were not continuing to the checkout to complete the buying journey.
                                                    A separate piece of analysis was undertaken to determine reasons for user abandonment in step 1 of the funnel. It was determined that this

                                                    extended from 5 minutes to 15 minutes.    </p>

                                  perform an upgrade action. This button actually opens a side panel of possible upgrades for this subscription, and the upgrade is

                                  upgrades are a separate action and not related to this function, so should not be grouped together. Some users were going to change quantities before upgrading.

                     read documentation available on material.io. I created a new component for the design system based on this and also worked with the UI Designer to 
                     create guidelines
                    for its use, so that other designers in the team could reference this. </p>

                                  Another change to licensing that was imposed as part of NCE was the time period allowed for reduction of subscription quantities.
                                The new business rules meant that there was a 7 day window where the partner could reduce the quantities of the subscription. 
                                Also whenever the partner increased the quantity of a subscription they received an additional 7 day window where they could 
                                 make a reduction to that specific quantity if needed.

                                        There was one minor fail (16.67%) recorded during the tests on one task only  - the discoverability of the tool.
                                        One user was not able to locate the correct button when asked to perform the task to schedule a change. 
                                        This task still passed as all other participants (83.33%) were able to find this tool correctly. 
                                        Some feedback was also recorded about possible future enhancements to the tool that would make it more usable.
                                        This related to beign able to modify a saved change where there was a backend restriction.
                                        I brought this feedback to the database team to look for improvements in this area.

                                        They were abe to understand what was happening and were able to view the number of quantities that were available to 
                                        reduce immediately and the time allowed for each, and were

                               There were a number of usability improvements that were made to the new commerce functionality following on from 
                               the tests. A sample of these are shown here. Additional messaging was introduced in the form of banners and tooltips to provide visibility of the current status of 
                               the New Commerce subscription. Other improvements related to the display of important information to the user and improvements to 
                               the license reduciton input tool.
