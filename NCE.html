In January 2022 Microsoft introduced an enhanced version of it's CSP program. The changes were enforced by Microsoft to all it's partners, which meant that these
changes had to be adopted by SoftwareONE. Changes impacted the partner portal 'ONEClub' in terms of how partners purchased, cancelled and managed their software subscriptions.
Being the UX Product Designer for ONEClub it was my responsibility to work with the business and partners to re-design the portal in order to introduce these changes while providing an enhanced
user experience.

This project involved numerous meetings and discussions with key stakeholders and development teams working to a time sensitive deadline.
 The project was undertaken from February-July 2022, implemented in stages, in conjunction with the various daily responsibilities and workload of my role.

                        I attended a number of early fact finding meetings with key stakeholders within the business in order to determine what the requirements 
                        for the proejct would be for UX. I met with the business owner of the product as well as the PM and also Business Development Managers. During weekly planning meetings
                        for the product development teams were also involved in the discussions. It became clear that delivering on the project would be the top priority for the team. The requirements were discussed
                        and it was decided that the implementations would be carried out in stages according to priority and timelines. <P>

                        I also spoke to partners during monthly recurring customer preview calls. The feedback from partners was that they wanted the new functionality being 
                        introduced by Microsoft and they felt that their customers would also demand these enhancements. Speaking to development managers from within the business 
                        they gave me the same feedback from customers. So both the business and our customers were aligned that these changes were needed and a top priority.

	 As part of the New Commercial Experience Microsoft introduced an additional purchasing option that had to be brought into the portal. Up to this point there were two purchasing 
   options 1) Monthly Billing with a Monthly Commitmentand 2) Yearly Billing with an Annual Commitment. The New Commerce Experience <b>added a third option - an Annual Commitment Term with a Monthly Billing option.</b>
   Reviewing the portal it became clear that <b>the purchasing cards in use would not be suitable for this additional third buying option.</b> This lead to a re-design of the product list and product detail pages.

 The existing product card design showed two purchasing options on the card in the product list view. The user could pick from one of these options and then add to cart immediately. 
 This design could not be scaled to include a third buying option so a re-design of the product card was needed.

                            An early approach was to to introduce the thrid buying option onto the product card in the product list. This design was tested but failed the UAT with users, as it was 
                            felt to be overly complex and confusing. The legacy design was not scalable and so a new approach was needed.

                              The design was rejected and following on from further iterations and research a final design was proposed. One purchasing option would be shown on the product card and the 'Buy Now' button would be changed to 
                              a 'View all buying options', the user flow would now change to go into the product card detail where the user could choose a buying option and then move into the checkout flow.
            Consulting with the business it was decided that the monthly pricing option would be shown as the default as it was the cheapest option and it was the industry standard
            for displaying e-commerce pricing terms.

                                    The thrid buying option was introduced into the product detail card. This lead to a complete redesign of this page.
                                    The user journey would now take the user from the product list into the product detail where all three buying options would be displayed.
                                    Initially the purchasing offerings were grouped by the commitment term, being either monthly or annual. 
                                    The additional billing options were then displayed. This approach was tested with users in the business and was felt to be too complex, so was not chosen as a final design proposal.

                 It was important to analyse user adoption of the new buying cards. Heap Analytics was used for this data analysis.
                  A new event was defined in Heap and used to create a separate Cart > Checout funnel for New Commerce products.
                  The intention was to validate the new design and to also obtain Quantitative data that backed up the Qualitative feedback from 
                  users during the UAT sessions of the new purchasing cards. The analysis was run for a 3 month period, following on from the 
                  deployment of the new cards to production in March 2022.

           With the new experience Microsoft enforced stricter rules relating to cancellations. After 
           7 days of purchase a subscription cound not longer be cancelled until the subscription renewal, where a 7 day period would be available again.
            Additional functionality was introduced that allowed partners to disable subscription renewal. This was introduced to the 
            subscription detail screen by using a renewal toggle switch. In addition a tooltip was used to inform partners of the business rules 
            if the toggle is switched on or off.

                         performed later in the user flow. The placement of the button was also moved to be above the quantity increase/decrease function and some padding was introduced as 
                        upgrades are a separate action and not related to this function, so should not be grouped together.  </p>
