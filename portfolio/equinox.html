            <h2><b>Concept Development</b></h2>
                       <p class="portfolio-detail-body">When visiting the National Museum a number of elements and designs 
                       stood out that could potentially be used in the design piece for a logo. 
                       The early Celtic symbols and monuments were of interest 
                       and studied to incorporate into the design. 
                      
                       During this exploratory phase the spirals that were carved into the monument
                       at Newgrange that symbolise the sun were noticed and researching the monument lead to the discovered that
                       it was built to capture the rising sun during the spring equinox when the sun would illuminate the passageway of the monument. 
The idea of using ‘Equinox’ as the name of the café was discovered and when researching the symbolic meaning 
behind the equinox it was discovered that it represented a time of renewal and rebirth and of reconnecting
with the world and feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. These feelings also overlap with the benefits 
and reasons of why people drink fruit juice and coffee so the name seemed very suitable to use for a café logo.
Once the name was decided for the café idea generation was begun uses sketches and writing out the word ‘Equinox’
to see what symbols could be used. Development of various ideas using Adobe Illustrator began.</p>

                     An eclipse was incorporated into the logo idea 
also the theme of a café was brought into the logo by using the icon of a coffee cup. Different colour schemes were experimented with.
The colour needed to represent the spring sun while also representing coffee.
A gradient using orange and yellow to represent the sun was developed and this colour scheme worked well 
as the warm colours are inviting and would attract the attention of someone that was
in need of warming and refreshing themselves by buying a coffee. The warm orange 
colour is also suitable as it triggers the idea of a refreshing breakfast, buying an 
orange juice to drink before you face the challenges of a new day.
Two final ideas from the designs were identified and explored in greater detail.</p>

                     The final logo design keeps the eclipse symbol but also uses the celtic spiral in place of 
                     the letter 'q' in the logo name. A coffee cup is used in place of the 'o' letter and a gradient effect is used 
                     on these symbols. 
                    The rest of the logo lettering is in a brown colour to reinforce the 
                    café subject and this colour is also associated with the earth so fits in well with the overall theme of the design. 
                    The final design is produced in grey scale also to ensure the design works well in black and white according to good design principles.

                    Branding material was also developed to accompany the new logo. This took the form of an A4 letterhead, 
                    a business card and a compliment slip. An A3 sized poster to promote the opening of the new cafe was also 
                    created.
