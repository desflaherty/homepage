	     The key branding principles were firstly decided upon.
	     Preliminary ideas were sketched and inspiration pieces 
	     were gathered from existing products on Behance, Dribbble, and Pinterest.

            <P class="portfolio-detail-body">
                The final designs and components of the brand were created including Guiding Principles,
            Logo, Colours, Typography, Image and Writing Style. The dominant colour being used is a 
            corporate blue as blue symbolizes trust, 
                     loyalty, confidence, technology and intelligence and is also associated with stability.
                     These are all appropriate symbols for a money saver app to be assocaited with.
            </p>
             <P class="portfolio-detail-body"> Logo ideas were brainstormed and the idea of using 
             a well was developed. Historically a well has been associated with health, community and abundance.
             These associations all suit the message that I am trying to align to the product and are also
             suitable to use with the brand colour. The name for the product is 'Save Well' what also communicates to the user
             that they will have healthy savings by using the product.

	   Rapid sketching methods as well as sketching templates were
	   used to sketch out initial ideas for the various screens. 
	   It was decided that onboarding screens would be used for the app as  
	   it would be important to give the user information on how and why they should 
	   use the app. They would need to be able to add their bank account 
	   and also be able to create and view a savings goal. The user will enter the name of the 
	   savings goal as well as the amount they want to save and the save duration, the app will then
	   calculate how much they need to save each month.
	   
	   
	   
	   The design would also need to include a homepage where the user
	   could view their financial informaiton that is linked to their bank acccount, as well as having a visual view of their 
	   finances on a dashboard. </p>
	  
	   <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	   From the possible solutions mid fidelity wireframes were
	   created using the Sketch software tool. The mid fidelity
	   wireframes were created using placeholders where
	   content and UI elements would later be developed during the high fidelity wireframing stage.

		The user can now register without having to pass through the 'add fingerprint' screen.
		And the requirement to add a bank card is now introduced after the user has completed registration
		and is no longer a part of the registration process. The more steps involved 
		in registration increases the risk that the user will drop off and not complete the process so these
		were important improvements to the design flow. Introducing the bank card at this stage was a cause of

		The flow was changed so that the user now creates a saving goal after the welcome 
		screen.During the usability testing concerns were raised that the 
		user was being directed to the home page after the welcome screen, where their bank account information 
		was being introduced. This caused confusion. The improvement means that a user now creates a saving goal 
		after the welcome screen and is then directed to their save well. From there they can access the homepage as 
		well as their dashboard and profile, as these buttons are available on the footer navigation.

to showcase how ‘Save Well’ would look in real life on a mobile screen.

to create an interactive guide. The final prototype can be viewed here.

		Deciding on the key branding principles for the project helped
		in the later design phase as the colour, typography and some 
		UI elements had been created, so the brand document acted as a useful guide. 
		Carrying out research early on in the project into existing similar apps also 
		helped to get an idea of the design patterns and the design look and feel that others are using,
		this research helped inspire my design choices.
		The user testing proved very useful and feedback
		that was obtained was used to improve the design and finished screens.
