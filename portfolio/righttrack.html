	      After finishing an intensive UI Design bootcamp I was actively looking for a new role. The longer I spent on job boards and looking for a 
	      job the more frustrations I discovered. I found it time consuming to be moving between a variety of different job board websites using the same 
	      keyword searches where the job results being returned were largely the same - as employers and recruiters were advertising the same role accross 
	      various job boards  - but the job seeker had to check every board anyway just in case they missed a job ad!
	      </p>
	      
	      
	      <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	      	Keeping track of applications also proved to be a pain point - and I found myself using an Excel spreadsheet to record applications.
	      </p>
	      
	       <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	      	I felt like these problems could be solved by the right app being designed so decided to undertake a project using a user centered design approach
	      to find out if the pain points and frustrations I felt were also being experienced by other job seekers.</P>

              A customer experience map was then designed as a tool for visualizing all of the journeys a customer of my app may experience,
              as well as a visual of how all of these journeys are connected.

The map will help me to determine where problems might be occurring within the customer’s overall experience.
By mapping out a customer’s entire product experience, any problem areas can be highlighted and visualized.
I designed the customer experience map for one of the personas I had created - in this example for the 'Career Changer'.

         A card sorting exercise was then conducted
          to evaluate and generate ideas for the information architecture of
          the app. The aim was to find patterns that give clues about
          the most logical and user-friendly way to organize my app. I involved participants using 'OptimalWorkshop' as the methodology and employed 
          an open card sort approach. Participants were asked to add the app 
          content into their own categories, then to name these categories.

      Next a site map was created. The goal here was to reflect
      the IA patterns of the product by laying out the page hierarchy of the application.
      From the homepage the users can navigate to six different sections. There are also 
      sub sections under these. The map acts as a visual aid to see the relationships
      between the pages and content of the app and ensures that the information
    I've collected and categorized is connected with a strong flow. The sitemap will 
    also be used as a reference point when designing the wireframes later in the process.

 I then began the ideation phase of sketching out screen ideas for the different users flows in the app.
 The plan for this phase was to create a paper prototype then test with users to iterate the design
 before moving on to develop high fidelity wireframes.

 <p class="portfolio-detail-body image-padding">
 I examined the data collected from the user research and also my user personas when brainstorming ideas.
 One of the comments that came from users needs was "An app like a Trello board just for the job search topic".
 I investigated the Trello app and noticed that a Kanban board was being used to organise content.
 I decided that a
 similar idea could be used for my app for the job tracker screen where saved jobs would be displayed so sketched out 
 this idea. Other user needs were taken into account when deciding on possible options for the navigation menu.

I created a paper prototype and again reached out to my slack channel group for testing and feedback.
Unfortunately I could find students to engage with the low fidelity prototype. 
It was at a time when students were under pressure to get assignments completed
and the fact that my design was in low fidelity format also contributed to the lack of interest I feel.
At this point I was stuck. I decided the only thing I could do to progress the project was to 
develop the wireframes to a high fidelity format and then return to the slack channel at a later point
and hope for better engagement.

 I chose 'Figma' as the software tool to use for the high fidelity wireframes and for the prototype development.
 To manage the transition from paper to digital protoype,
 I created greyscale wireframes and then developed these into high fidelity. 
 I developed a working prototype of some of the  basic user flows from linking the wireframes together
 so that I could test these with my end users. A selection of some of the wireframes demonstrating the user flows is shown here.

Another concern was raised regarding the 'Sign In to LinkedIn' screen. It was felt that this was also 
confusing as it was not clear to users what they were being asked to do on this screen. 
A LinkedIn logo was being used but was replaced 
by a 'Sign In to LinkedIn' heading to clarify to the user what they needed to do on this screen.

<P></P>
                 <LI> 	   
The hidden password icon was displayed in a yellow colour initially but this was changed to green as green is the primary colour being used
for actions.
</LI>
<p></p>
<LI> 	   
For consistency the order that the primary and secondary buttons was changed here also.
