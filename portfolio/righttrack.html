	      After finishing an intensive UI Design bootcamp I was actively looking for a new role. The longer I spent on job boards and looking for a 
	      job the more frustrations I discovered. I found it time consuming to be moving between a variety of different job board websites using the same 
	      keyword searches where the job results being returned were largely the same - as employers and recruiters were advertising the same role accross 
	      various job boards  - but the job seeker had to check every board anyway just in case they missed a job ad!
	      </p>
	      
	      <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	      	Keeping track of applications also proved to be a pain point - and I found myself using an Excel spreadsheet to record applications.
	      </p>
	      
	       <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	      	I felt like these problems could be solved by the right app being designed so decided to undertake a project using a user centered design approach
	      to find out if the pain points and frustrations I felt were also being experienced by other job seekers.</P>

                <b>Strengths:</b>
 •	One of the few apps specifically dedicated to job tracking. There’s many project management tools out there, but most need to be ‘hacked’ into a job search template or model.
•	Nice UI – web app has useful features such as a Kanban board.
•	Has a web app as well as iOS.
•	Changes made in the mobile will update in the web app they work together.
•	Has an extension to add to the browser.

                 <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
               <B>Weaknesses:</B> 
               
               •	The app will only save the job feed for search results and not the specific job that you are viewing.
               •	The web app doesn’t return many listings for Dublin – a keyword search for ‘ux designer’ returned only 4 jobs.
             •	Some of the jobs displayed are expired on the company board.
             •	The web app can’t filter by job boards in the search.
             •	The web app isn’t user friendly on mobile, it’s clunky and cluttered. The navigation is squashed and at the top of the screen away from a user’s thumbs that makes it harder to use.
               
               
               
               </p>
                
            
                 <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
              <b>Opportunities:</b>
              •	The web app does not find many local job listings and displays expired ads. It is designed with a US market in mind. My web app could contain Irish listings and be focused on the Irish market.
•	The web app has usability issues on mobile.	
•	The native app version has usability issues when adding searched jobs.
•	Only offers a limited amount of jobs (40) that can be tracked on the free version.
              </p>
                
               
                 <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
             <b>Threats:</b>
             •	The UI of the app is nice and there are some nice features. However the app has usability issues and a better app could be introduced to the market.
•	Project management apps such as Asana or Atlassian could introduce a better version with marketing support.

                    Products that are available for organising tasks using a Kanban board include 'Trello', 'Asana' and 'Jira'. These 
                    tools are intended for collaboration mainly and have no job searching function. They could be used as organisers for 
                    job tracking however. Job searching apps include 'IrishJobs', 'LinkedIn', 'Monster', and 'Glassdoor'. These tools have limited 
                    fucnitonality for tracking job applications and each tool has to be used separately.

                 	<b>Patterns/Trends:</b> The respondents all have an interest in the nutritional composition of the food they will be eating.
                   This could be macro nutrients such as protein composition but also calories and sugar and salt levels.
                   Vitamins are important also. 
                   They do not seem to be aware of apps that could help them find their requirements but

                   sugar and salt which aren’t that healthy so having vegan meals that also show

                   before eating so they were covered by insurance in case there was gluten in his meal.</p>
