	      After finishing an intensive UI Design bootcamp I was actively looking for a new role. The longer I spent on job boards and looking for a 
	      job the more frustrations I discovered. I found it time consuming to be moving between a variety of different job board websites using the same 
	      keyword searches where the job results being returned were largely the same - as employers and recruiters were advertising the same role accross 
	      various job boards  - but the job seeker had to check every board anyway just in case they missed a job ad!
	      </p>
	      
	      <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	      	Keeping track of applications also proved to be a pain point - and I found myself using an Excel spreadsheet to record applications.
	      </p>
	      
	       <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	      	I felt like these problems could be solved by the right app being designed so decided to undertake a project using a user centered design approach
	      to find out if the pain points and frustrations I felt were also being experienced by other job seekers.</P>

                <b>Strengths:</b>
 •	One of the few apps specifically dedicated to job tracking. There’s many project management tools out there, but most need to be ‘hacked’ into a job search template or model.
•	Nice UI – web app has useful features such as a Kanban board.
•	Has a web app as well as iOS.
•	Changes made in the mobile will update in the web app they work together.
•	Has an extension to add to the browser.

               <B>Weaknesses:</B> 
               
               •	The app will only save the job feed for search results and not the specific job that you are viewing.
               •	The web app doesn’t return many listings for Dublin – a keyword search for ‘ux designer’ returned only 4 jobs.
             •	Some of the jobs displayed are expired on the company board.
             •	The web app can’t filter by job boards in the search.
             •	The web app isn’t user friendly on mobile, it’s clunky and cluttered. The navigation is squashed and at the top of the screen away from a user’s thumbs that makes it harder to use.

              <b>Opportunities:</b>
              •	The web app does not find many local job listings and displays expired ads. It is designed with a US market in mind. My web app could contain Irish listings and be focused on the Irish market.
•	The web app has usability issues on mobile.	
•	The native app version has usability issues when adding searched jobs.
•	Only offers a limited amount of jobs (40) that can be tracked on the free version.

•	Project management apps such as Asana or Atlassian could introduce a better version with marketing support.
