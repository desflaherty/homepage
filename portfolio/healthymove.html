	      'Healthy Move' is a location based recommendation app that I designed as

	      have a particular dietary requirement such as Gluten Free or Vegan.</p>

                       are looking towards healthier options in general.

                 <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
                 	The respondents all have an interest in the nutritional composition of the food they will be eating.
                   This could be macro nutrients such as protein composition but also calories and sugar and salt levels.
                   Vitamins are important also. 
                   They do not seem to be aware of apps that could help them find their requirements but
                   are relying on web research or word of mouth.</p>
                   
                    <h3><b>Call Outs:</b></h3>  
                 <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
                 Some Vegan alternatives seem to be based around processed food that can be high
                   sugar and salt which aren’t that healthy so having Vegan meals that also show 
                   nutritional content would be an important feature to the app.</p>
                
                <h3><b>Frustrations:</b></h3>  
                 <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
                The respondent that has Celiac disease mentioned that he didn’t know of any apps that would find him GF meals so he has to ask the staff members in the restaurant. He mentioned that he brings his own bread sometimes for meals and was once asked by a restaurant to sign a waiver
                   before eating so they were covered by insurance in case there was Gluten in his meal.</p>
                
                  <h3><b>Needs/Wants:</b></h3>  
                 <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
              Having a photo of the meals was mentioned by all as well as having nutritional information on the meals. Different groups would have different nutritional goals such as Vegan, Gluten Free or High Protein, Low Carb.</p>

                        The user flows formed the foundation for initial design sketches. The 'crazy 8s' rapid sketching method was used whereby an A4 sized
                        piece of paper is folder into 8 squares and a 60 second timelimit per square is given to sketch out initial ideas. Different iterations
                        of sketching were used to develop ideas for the needed screens and features. A dot vote was used to mark the best ideas from the sketches.
                        The dot voted designs were pooled together to create a paper prototype for the app. Prott was used to develop the interactive paper prototype.

                       There were some useful insights that were discovered from analysing the feedback from the tests. The feedback lead to a redesign
                       of the diet filter buttons on the homepage so that they were more intuitive and visually pleasing. Horizontal scrolling buttons were to be used
                       with an additional filter button that would open a separate screen of extra filter options. It was also decided to redesign 
                       the footer navigation reducing complexity so that there would be only three main sections needed - Explore, Map and Profile. 
                       The Explore screen would allow users to search by listing name on the same screen as being able to filter by diet requirement and also change their location using a drop down menu.

	               A moodboard was created to demonstrate the proposed design look and feel. Two varying styles of moodboard were designed as can be viewed below.
	               Certain ketwords were used to help project the feeling and idea behind the design styles. One style uses green as the primary colour with yellow as an accent and 
	               a ligher shade of green to support as well as shades of grey. An alternative design uses a brighter orange as the primary with bright green as an accent and 
	               supporting colours of dark green and grey. It was decided to use the first moodboard as the colour scheme for the app as it was felt that the colours were more
	               appropriate and the alternative moodboard was possibly more suited to a fruit drink or juice bar as opposed to a health food app.

	              Once I had figured out the main user flow and screens for the app 
	              I created a number of sets of wireframes to give a better idea of how the information
	              and functional elements would be laid out. 
	              These were then 
	           iterated on until I settled on a final
	              set of wireframes which were later used as the basis for the visual design of the app. During this process my tutor and  was consulted 
	              for feedback. Once the final screens were designed a style guide was also created as a reference to the Typography, Colour Scheme, UI Elements, 
	              Imagery and Icons used in the design of the app that should be followed if there are to be any amendments or additions to the app. In addition to 
	              wireframes sample responsive screens were developed for iPad and Laptop. The images below show mid to high fidelity screens that were created.

	        Also testing a low fidelity wireframe sketch early in the process proved beneficial as it helped shape future design decisions.
