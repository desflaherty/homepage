                   Vitamins are important also.

                   before eating so they were covered by insurance in case there was Gluten in his meal.</p>

	         Based on all the information learned in the research stage as well as assessing 
	         what features the app would provide for
	         users I mapped out the primary screens of the app from login to end goal. 
	        A number of user stories were created that led to the development of user flows.
	         It was important to make the user journey flow intuitively so that it was a simple process from beginning to end.
	         Each user flow had an entry point and a success criteria. 
	         A sample of some of the user flows that were created can be viewed in this section.

                        The user flows formed the foundation for initial design sketches. The 'crazy 8s' rapid sketching method was used whereby an A4 sized
                        piece of paper is folder into 8 squares and a 60 second timelimit per square is given to sketch out initial ideas. Different iterations
                        of sketching were used to develop ideas for the needed screens and features. A dot vote was used to mark the best ideas from the sketches.
                        The dot voted designs were pooled together to create a paper prototype for the app. Prott was used to develop the interactive paper prototype.

	               A moodboard was created to demonstrate the proposed design look and feel. Two varying styles of moodboard were designed as can be viewed below.
	               Certain keywords were used to help convey the feeling and idea behind the design styles. One style uses green as the primary colour with yellow as an accent and 
	               a ligher shade of green to support as well as shades of grey. An alternative design uses a brighter orange as the primary with bright green as an accent and 
	               supporting colours of dark green and grey. It was decided to use the Moodboard 1 as the colour scheme for the app as it was felt that the colours were more
	               appropriate and the alternative moodboard was possibly more suited to a fruit drink or juice bar as opposed to a health food app.

	              Once I had figured out the main user flow and screens for the app

	              and functional elements would be laid out. 
	              These were then 
	           iterated on until I settled on a final
	              set of wireframes which were later used as the basis for the visual design of the app. Once the final screens were designed a style guide was also created as a reference to the Typography, Colour Scheme, UI Elements, 
	              Imagery and Icons used in the design of the app that should be followed if there are to be any amendments or additions to the app. In addition to

	        I have studied Marketing and have also worked in Marketing Analytics 
	        so I believe this background helped me in the early phases 
	        of the project to formulate research questions 
	        and to conduct the user interviews and the development of the online survey and the user personas.
	        Also testing a low fidelity wireframe sketch early on in the process proved beneficial as it helped shape future design decisions.
	        Online research to gather inspiration and the development of a moodboard also helped to create the final design look and feel.

	       It took me a few attempts at the crazy 8 design sprint methodology before I was able to 
	       start generating design ideas, coming up with different looks for the same screen was soemthing that was a challenge also. 
	       The user flows were an area that I found to be quite tricky and time consuming but spending time getting the user flows correct after a 
	       number of iterations helped with the design of the wireframes at a later point in the process.

	       I moved from low fidelity wireframes to high fidelity adding a lot of detail and creating finished mockups before getting additional feedback from users.
	       The feedback from the user tests for the final screens was mostly positive, any constructive feedback was reviewed and amendments were made. In future however 
	       I need to remember to move to mid fidelity and test with users before adding additional detail as the final screens should be based on additional user feedback
