           On the free version of the app there are large ads to sign up to premium that are annoying as they appear

                 	<b>Patterns/Trends:</b> The respondents all have an interest in the nutritional composition of the food they will be eating.
                   This could be macro nutrients such as protein composition but also calories and sugar and salt levels.
                   Vitamins are important also. 
                   They do not seem to be aware of apps that could help them find their requirements but
                   are relying on web research or word of mouth.</p>
                   
                
                 <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
                <B>Call Outs:</B> Some vegan alternatives seem to be based around processed food that can be high
                   sugar and salt which aren’t that healthy so having vegan meals that also show 
                   nutritional content would be an important feature to the app.</p>

                <b>Frustrations:</b>The respondent that has Celiac disease mentioned that he didn’t know of any apps that would find him GF meals so he has to ask the staff members in the restaurant. He mentioned that he brings his own bread sometimes for meals and was once asked by a restaurant to sign a waiver
                   before eating so they were covered by insurance in case there was gluten in his meal.</p>

                        The user flows formed the foundation for initial design sketches. The 'crazy 8s' rapid sketching method was used whereby an A4 sized
                        piece of paper is folded into 8 squares and a 60 second timelimit per square is given to sketch out initial ideas. Different iterations
                        of sketching were used to develop ideas for the needed screens and features. A dot vote was used to mark the best ideas from the sketches.
                        The dot voted designs were pooled together to create a paper prototype for the app. Prott was used to develop the interactive paper prototype.

                        The feedback led to a redesign
                       of the diet filter buttons on the homepage so that they were more intuitive and visually pleasing.

	               A moodboard was created to demonstrate the proposed design look and feel. Two varying styles of moodboard were designed, as can be viewed below.
	               Certain keywords were used to help convey the feeling and idea behind the design styles. One style uses green as the primary colour with yellow as an accent and 
	               a ligher shade of green to support as well as shades of grey. An alternative design uses a brighter orange as the primary with bright green as an accent and 
	               supporting colours of dark green and grey. It was decided to use the 'Moodboard 1' as the colour scheme for the app, as it was felt that the colours were more
	               appropriate and the alternative moodboard was possibly more suited to a fruit drink or juice bar, as opposed to a health food app.

	              Once I had figured out the main user flow and screens for the app 
	              I created a number of wireframes to get a better idea of how the information
	              and functional elements would be laid out. 
	              These were then 
	           iterated on until I settled on a final
	              set of wireframes which were later used as the basis for the visual design of the app. Once the final screens were designed a style guide was also created as a reference to the Typography, Colour Scheme, UI Elements, 
	              Imagery and Icons used in the design of the app that should be followed if there are to be any amendments or additions to the app. In addition to 
	              wireframes sample responsive screens were developed for iPad and Laptop. The images below show mid to high fidelity screens that were created.

	        and to conduct the user interviews and the development of the online survey and the user personas.
	        Also testing a low fidelity wireframe sketch early on in the process proved beneficial as it helped shape future design decisions.
	        Online research to gather inspiration and the development of a moodboard also helped to create the final design look and feel.

	       It took me a few attempts at the crazy 8 design sprint methodology before I was able to 
	       start generating design ideas, coming up with different looks for the same screen was something that was a challenge also. 
	       The user flows were an area that I found to be quite tricky and time consuming but spending time getting the user flows correct after a 
	       number of iterations helped with the design of the wireframes at a later point in the process.
