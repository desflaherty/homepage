	   ‘One Day’ is a health and wellness mobile app that aims to improve a users overall
mental and physical wellbeing by cmaking positive changes to their daily habits and routines.
The app will be a resource that will promote healthy

methods and techniques.
By using the app users will change their habits and thought processes for one day
which could lead to the development of new life changing habits.</p>

                        The user flows formed the foundation for initial design sketches. The 'crazy 8s' rapid sketching method was used whereby an A4 sized
                        piece of paper is folder into 8 squares and a 60 second timelimit per square is given to sketch out initial ideas. Different iterations
                        of sketching were used to develop ideas for the needed screens and features. A dot vote was used to mark the best ideas from the sketches.
                        The dot voted designs were pooled together to create a paper prototype for the app. Prott was used to develop the interactive paper prototype.

	               A moodboard was created to demonstrate the proposed design look and feel. Two varying styles of moodboard were designed as can be viewed below.
	               Certain ketwords were used to help project the feeling and idea behind the design styles. One style uses green as the primary colour with yellow as an accent and 
	               a ligher shade of green to support as well as shades of grey. An alternative design uses a brighter orange as the primary with bright green as an accent and 
	               supporting colours of dark green and grey. It was decided to use the first moodboard as the colour scheme for the app as it was felt that the colours were more
	               appropriate and the alternative moodboard was possibly more suited to a fruit drink or juice bar as opposed to a health food app.

	              Once I had figured out the main user flow and screens for the app

	              and functional elements would be laid out. 
	              These were then 
	           iterated on until I settled on a final
	              set of wireframes which were later used as the basis for the visual design of the app. During this process my tutor and  was consulted 
	              for feedback. Once the final screens were designed a style guide was also created as a reference to the Typography, Colour Scheme, UI Elements, 
	              Imagery and Icons used in the design of the app that should be followed if there are to be any amendments or additions to the app. In addition to 
	              wireframes sample responsive screens were developed for iPad and Laptop. The images below show mid to high fidelity screens that were created.

	  			A preference test was conducted using the UsabilityHub website. A complete mockup was tested along with a variation screen to obtain user feedback.

	  			profile white screen performed better with a score of 58%. While the difference is not statistically significant respondents answered that they preferred
	  			this design style as easier to look at, it was more elegant, more organised and clearer in appearance.

	        I have studied Marketing and have also worked in Marketing Analytics 
	        so I believe this background helped me in the early phases 
	        of the project to formulate research questions

	        Also testing a low fidelity wireframe sketch early in the process proved beneficial as it helped shape future design decisions.
	        Online research to gather inspiration and the development of a moodboard also helped to create the final design look and feel.

	       I moved from low fidelity wireframes to high fidelity adding a lot of detail and creating finished mockups before getting additional feedback from users.
