                        The user flows formed the foundation for initial low fidelity wireframes using balsamiq.
                        These initial wireframes were designed for iOS bearing in mind iOS guidelines. At this stage sketching using paper and pencil
                        would have also been appropriate but because I had not used the Balsamiq software yet I wanted to use this low fidelity wireframing 
                        approach. The screens developed gave me an initial idea as to how the elements would be placed and what content would be included in the app as 
                        well as considerations such as the navigation elements - footer menu , tabs, user search form etc.

                      After the initial design of low fidelity wireframes for iOS similar screens 
                      were created for Android following the material design guidelines.
                      Each screen was annotated as part of the process to identify the different elements 
                      for iOS and Android to ensure that guidelines were followed correctly and that
                      native mobile design patterns were encorporated into the wireframes.</P>

	       <p class="portfolio-detail-body">After initital wireframes were developed a further phase involved researching similar apps
	       on the web to determine features and elements that could be incorporated into my mobile app also. Also during this phase of iteration
	       I discussed my designs with my tutor and based on feedback as well as guidelines researched for iOS and Android a further iteration of 
	       high fidelity wireframes were developed.
          </P>
        <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
            Careful consideration was paid to the end users of the app during the visual design process. 
            Areas of design that were researched during this phase included; Colour theory and principles, UI trends,
            Typography, Flat Design & Material Design and Iconography.
        </p> 
        <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
            The idea for the design was to use different colours for the different sections within the app - home, morning, commuting and evening.
            It makes sense to use warm colours such as yellow and orange for the morning to promote the feeling of energy and freshness aligned with the sun,
            and the evening uses a relaxing darker colour in this case purple and blue, which have associations with spirituality and calmness. 
             A card UI design is used within the app with imagery representing the content that the user can link to.

	      <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
            The next phase was to create a prototype that could be tested with users for feedback. Based on this 
            feedback changes were made to the designs before being finalized. The overall feedback from users that tested the app was positive.
            They liked the idea to use colours to identify different moments of the day. They felt that the screens were well designed 
            and that the styling worked well with the theme, making them feel relaxed. They also felt that the intention of the app 
            was clear and that they knew how to use it from the screens presented. Some constructive critism lead to some design changes as 
            outlined below.
        </p>
	      <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	          One pain point for users of the app seemed to be the 'Commuting' screen. They felt that the tabs at the top of the screen looked wrong and 
	          they would have preferred the screen design to have the same style as the 'Morning' screen, with cards used for the different selection choices. This feedback was taken on board and the 
	          screen was redesigned as can be seen below.
	      </p>
	         
	          <div class="col-xs-11 col-sm-6 col-md-6">

	        <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	         Another piece of feedback related to the 'Sleepcast' screen, where users felt that there was too much horizontal spacing 
	         between the card elements. The padding between the cards was corrected for consistency and improves the visual design.
	         
	         <div class="col-xs-11 col-sm-6 col-md-6">

	         <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	         For the login and sign up screens there was some useful feedback from users. They noted that the 
	         sign up button blended into the background image so was not clear to see, and as this is a call to 
	         action button it should contrast with the background to be easily identified. The solution that was used was
	         to lower the opacity of the background image and use a white input box behind the login and sign up fields so that
	         they stood out more. Also changing the colour of the sign up button from dark grey to orange so that it more 
	         visible. Another piece of feedback was that the screen looked a bit bare, so the logo design was incorporated into these
	         screens also.

	             Based on the feedback from the usability testing the design was modified and the final screens were developed.
	             The changes inlcuded the issues as already mentioned where the spacing and alignment was corrected on screens and the 
	             login and sign up screens were adjusted. In addition the tabs for Android were changed to be more in line with material design, 
	             where an underline under text is used as opposed to a rounded button style. Additional screens were also developed 
	             in the final design to include an error message screen if a user enters their login details incorrectly, and a tooltip for the sign up screen 
	             that shows a user if they have entered a strong password during sign up. Also an empty screen for
	             when a user enters an invalid search choice was created to demonstrate how this feedback would appear to the user.

	        As this was my third project using the Sketch software I am more comforatable and quicker using it which
	        has saved time during the wireframes iteration phases. Early research into existing apps that I can learn from as well as 
	        studying UI elelments that related to iOS and Android also helped in the desing of the wireframes. The usability tests 
	        also yielded some constructive feedback that I was able to use to improve the final screens.
