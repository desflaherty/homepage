                        The user flows formed the foundation for initial low fidelity wireframes using balsamiq.
                        These initial wireframes were designed for iOS bearing in mind iOS guidelines. At this stage sketching using paper and pencil
                        would have also been appropriate but because I had not used the balsamiq software yet I wanted to use this low fidelity wireframing 
                        approach. The screens that were developed gave me an initial idea as to how the elements would be placed and what content would be included in the app as 
                        well as considerations such as the navigation elements - footer menu , tabs, user search form etc.

                      After the initial design of low fidelity wireframes for iOS low fidelity wireframes were also
                      created for Android following the material design guidelines. The wireframes were then
                      developed further using Sketch. At this point UI elements were introduced
  
                      for iOS and Android to ensuring that guidelines were followed correctly and that
                      native mobile design patterns were encorporated into the wireframes.</P>

	       <p class="portfolio-detail-body">After initial wireframes were developed a further phase involved researching similar apps
	       on the web to determine features and elements that could be incorporated into my mobile app also. During this phase of iteration 
	       guidelines for iOS and Android development were researched and this led to the development of high fidelity wireframes.
	      
          </P>
        <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
            Careful consideration was paid to the end users of the app during the visual design process. 
            Areas of design that were researched during this phase included; Colour theory and principles, UI trends,
            Typography, Flat Design & Material Design and Iconography.
        </p> 
        
        <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
           Iterations based on feedback from my Tutor lead to adjustments and improvements in the design choices. Some screens 
           were dropped as it was decided they were not needed, also a more consistent style was developed in terms of the layout of the 
           content. Design choices were improved on also as can be seen in the 'Stretching' screen where the use of card elements to display
           different areas of the human body was replaced by a skeletal muscle image where the user could click on different body parts to 
           find a video tutorial.

        <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
           	I developed the idea to use different colours for the different sections within the app - 'Home', 'Morning', 'Commuting' and 'Evening'.
            It seemed appropriate to use warm colours such as yellow and orange for the morning section to promote the feeling of energy and freshness aligned with the sun,
            and the evening section uses a relaxing darker colour, in this case purple and blue, which have associations with spirituality and calmness.

            The next phase was to create a prototype that could be tested with users for feedback. Based on this 
            feedback changes were made to the designs before being finalised. The overall feedback from users that tested the app was positive.
            They liked the idea to use colours to identify different moments of the day. They felt that the screens were well designed 
            and that the styling worked well with the theme, making them feel relaxed. They also felt that the intention of the app 
            was clear and that they knew how to use it from the screens presented. Some constructive criticism led to some design changes as 
            outlined below.
        </p>
	      <p class="portfolio-detail-body">
	          One pain point for users of the app seemed to be the 'Commuting' screen. They felt that the tabs at the top of the screen looked wrong and 
	          they would have preferred the screen design to have the same style as the 'Morning' screen, with cards used for the different selection choices. This feedback was taken on board and the 
	          screen was redesigned as can be seen below.

	         For the 'Log In' and 'Sign up' screens there was some useful feedback from users also. They noted that the 'Sign Up' button blended into the background image so was not easily visible, and as this is a call to action button it should contrast with the background to be easily identified. The colour of the 'Sign Up' button was changed from dark grey to orange so that it was more visible.

Users found the fields on the ‘Log In and ‘Sign Up’ screens a bit hard to see and noted that
the background image was a distraction.The solution that was used was to lower the opacity of the background
image and use a white input box behind the 'Log In' and 'Sign Up' fields so that they stood out more. 
Another piece of feedback noted that the screen looked a bit bare, so the logo design was incorporated into these screens.

	             Based on the feedback from the usability testing the design was modified and the final screens were developed.
	             The changes reflected improvements to the spacing and alignment of screens and the 
	             'Log In' and 'Sign Up' screens were adjusted as mentioned. In addition the tabs for Android were changed to be more in line with material design, 
	             where an underline with text is used as opposed to a rounded button style. Additional screens were also developed 
	             in the final design to include an error message screen to capture a user entering their 'Log In' details incorrectly, and a tooltip for the 'Sign Up' screen 
	             that gives feedback to a user regarding the strength of their password during sign up. Also an 'empty state' screen for
	             when a user enters an invalid search choice was created to demonstrate how this feedback would appear to the user.

			 Early research into existing apps as well as

	        The usability tests 
	        yielded some constructive feedback that I was able to use to improve the final screens.
