                        The user flows formed the foundation for initial design sketches. The 'crazy 8s' rapid sketching method was used whereby an A4 sized
                        piece of paper is folded into 8 squares and a 60 second timelimit per square is given to sketch out initial ideas. Different iterations
                        of sketching were used to develop ideas for the needed screens and features. A dot vote was used to mark the best ideas from the sketches.
                        The dot voted designs were pooled together to create a paper prototype for the app. Prott was used to develop the interactive paper prototype.

                      to test the usability of the app by testing the user flows. I wanted to ensure that the potential users can navigate through the app
                      and accomplish the tasks that I have set for them and also to identify any pain points or areas of tension

	        Apps and websites were researched online to get inspiration for the look and feel of the new proposed app. Websites such as Dribbble, Behance,

	               A moodboard was created to demonstrate the proposed design look and feel. Two varying styles of moodboard were designed, as can be viewed below.
	               Certain keywords were used to help convey the feeling and idea behind the design styles. One style uses green as the primary colour with yellow as an accent and 
	               a ligher shade of green to support as well as shades of grey. An alternative design uses a brighter orange as the primary with bright green as an accent and 
	               supporting colours of dark green and grey. It was decided to use the 'Moodboard 1' as the colour scheme for the app, as it was felt that the colours were more
	               appropriate and the alternative moodboard was possibly more suited to a fruit drink or juice bar, as opposed to a health food app.

	         <p class="portfolio-detail-body table-padding">
	           <B>Yellow</B> was chosen as the secondary colour as it sits next to green on the colour wheel and acts as a

	         </p>

	              Once I had figured out the main user flow and screens for the app 
	              I created a number of wireframes to get a better idea of how the information
	              and functional elements would be laid out. 
	              These were then 
	           iterated on until I settled on a final
	              set of wireframes which were later used as the basis for the visual design of the app. Once the final screens were designed a style guide was also created as a reference to the Typography, Colour Scheme, UI Elements, 
	              Imagery and Icons used in the design of the app that should be followed if there are to be any amendments or additions to the app. In addition to 
	              wireframes sample responsive screens were developed for iPad and Laptop. The images below show mid to high fidelity screens that were created.

	  			A preference test was conducted using the UsabilityHub website. A complete mockup was tested along with a variation screen to obtain user feedback.
	  			Respondents were asked to choose which button style they preferred and to also give a reason for their choice. From a group of 20 respondents the 
	  			profile white screen performed better with a score of 58%. While the difference is not statistically significant respondents answered that they preferred
	  			this design style as it was easier to look at, it was more elegant, more organised and clearer in appearance.

	  		The final screens were critiqued by members of the UI design course. The overall feedback was positive and any constructive feedback was
	  		taken onboard and led to some minor adjustments in the design, relating to padding of images and alignment issues as well as typography corrections.
	  		The reviewers liked the design and the concept of the app. They liked the colour
	  		scheme and
	  		professional feel. They also found it functional and easy to use.</P>
