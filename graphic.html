                      <u><h3>The Brief:</h3></u>
                      <p>From studying historic and contemporary design practitioners, the task was to complete a finished piece of work 
                      using one of the design techniques researched. The design should be based on images or locations that you encounter 
                      on your journey to work or that you would come in contact with on a daily basis.</p>
                       <u><h3>Concept Development:</h3></u>
                       <p>A comparative analysis previously undertaken focused on Swiss style graphic design and
                       this was the style I developed for this project. My initial idea was to use the subject of
                       flight as my topic choice. I live near Dublin airport and also the beach where there is an
                       abundance of wildlife so this was why I chose this idea.</p>
                       <p>I researched Swiss style design pieces that could help me create and 
                       idea for the piece. I reviewed posters created by Swiss designers such as Armin Hofmann, 
                       Max Huber and Joseph Müller-Brockmann. During this research phase a particular poster designed by Armin Hofmann stood out to me created to promote an exhibition at the Museum of Applied Arts in Basel (Gewerbemuseum) in 1961. A single bright red colour was used in the poster design. He cut out four red shapes and used white space between the shapes and used text in an easily legible form in the upper left part of the image. The type size used corresponds to the relative value of the information and grows smaller from one column to the next. The differences in type sizes also lend the poster rhythm and depth. The shapes used in the poster design looked to me to be similar to that of a plane wing and I used this poster as the inspiration for my final A3 piece</p>
                     <u><h3>Development of A3 Poster using Adobe Illustrator:</h3></u>
                     <P>The design uses negative space to create the image of a falcon. I decided to develop this idea as I thought it worked well. I created an airplane wing at the bottom part of the poster to give the poster some depth and included an airline motto type ‘service, safety, security’ to the bottom left of the poster to make use of the whitespace there. The type slopes from the left to the right and looks visually pleasing. I used asymmetrical shapes to develop the image of the falcon and found this to be challenging to achieve the desired effect. The falcon image that was developed works reasonably well the viewer can clearly make out the bird shape with the head, body, wings and tail elements being recognizable. The shape of the bird also looks like the shape of a stealth bomber airplane with the pointed wing tips adding a dynamic feel of movement to the image. The poster is asymmetrical but shows order and alignment as much as possible in accordance with Swiss style of design. The airline name ‘Falcon airlines’ is positioned in the center of the poster and clearly stands out. There are two identical shapes used to represent an airline cockpit window to the right of the poster and these also create the tail appearance for the falcon shape.  A white line was added to the bottom wing shape to enforce the wing effect which works well I feel. The final shape used was a sky blue triangular shape representing sky and freedom which helps enforce the overall theme and gives the falcon shape the feeling of movement with the sky in the background. This contrasts well with the deep corporate blue used to represent the parts of the aircraft depicted which are the wings and cockpit windows. I added some red colour to the triangle shape above the falcon’s head leading off the screen which helps give the poster a dynamic effect and contrasts well with the blue and white colour scheme used. The airline name ‘FALCON’ is capitalized and the colour used is the same dark corporate blue as the airline wings, a red underline is also used here to emphasize the name as it is the most important piece of type on the poster. The word for ‘airline’ is in lower case and tracking is used to make the type feel more airy which is appropriate for the theme used, the colour used here is the same sky blue as used in the image at the top of the poster representing the sky and the two words are aligned vertically . The type used is ‘Akzidenz Grotesk’ as this was a favourite type of the Swiss practitioners that I had researched.</P>

                      <u><h3>The Brief:</h3></u>
                      <p>The task was to research a given typeface and to produce an A3 poster to promote that typeface.</p>
                       <u><h3>Concept Development:</h3></u>
                       <p>The research should look into the history of the typeface - its designer and any other relevant information.
                       You should analyze the findings to consider how to use this information when designing the poster. The poster should visually indicate the unique characters of the typeface along with any relevant peices of information necessary to promote the typeface.</p>
                        <p>I initially undertook some research into the font to help formulate an idea and come up with a theme that could be used in the project. I discovered that the font was created in 1925 by Eric Gill who was a leading English sculptor and stonemason at the time. The Perpetua font was used a lot in tombstones and war memorials which is the reason that I chose the idea of a war memorial for the final project piece. When undertaking the background research for the project I looked at existing posters where the font had been used as well as the book covers where the font was used such as the Penguin classics and the New Shakespeare series 1934-56. There were also modern uses of the font such as the poster for the movie ‘The Untouchables’ and ‘Robin Hood Prince of Thieves’. The Perpetua font had also been used by ‘Continental’ airlines and ‘Bacardi’ the alcohol drinks company. I began sketching possible ideas that might work with the font. Some early ideas included a poster advertising a whiskey brand and another advertising Harley Davidson motorbikes with a pub called ‘The Perpetua’ being displayed in the background. During the research phase I also reviewed images of war memorials and I decided that the strongest idea was to create a war memorial.</p>
                     <u><h3>Development of A3 Poster using Adobe Illustrator:</h3></u>
                    <p>I began creating shapes fitting with the theme of a graveyard and Irish war memorial. I created a lizard shape using an ‘I’ for the body and ‘r’s for the legs and a ‘v’ letter for the head shown on the left side of the poster. Above this I created Celtic spiral shapes using the letter ‘e’ and above this a Celtic cross using the letter ‘I’ intersecting with a ‘O’ letter in the background. At the top of the poster I created snake shapes using the ‘S’ letter with a ‘V’ letter used again for the snake head. I created the image of a star medal in the top right of the poster using the ‘V’ letter again rotating the letter to create the shape. I created the stone effect for the background by using a gradient and then using the effects panel in Illustrator. I used a drop shadow to make the epitaph part of the poster stand out. Additional images were added here such as a snowflake image created using the ‘v’ letter and I also created a clock using roman numerals in the Perpetua font family to signify the idea of time being finite and precious fitting with the theme of death and war. I used a blood red colour for the heading font family name ‘Perpetua’ as the contrast works well with the dark black and grey background and used white text for the informative piece but changing the lettering sizes and adding the red colour to some letters to give a blood spattered effect.</p>

                      <u><h3>The Brief:</h3></u>
                      <p>The task was to visit the National Museum of Archaeology and carry out research that 
                      would lead to the development of a new logo for the Museum cafe.</p>
                       <u><h3>Concept Development:</h3></u>
                       <p>Initital research was undertaken with photos and quick sketches of interesting pieces in the museum.
                       This lead to the design of three logo concepts from which a final logo was developed.
                       A branded literature suite was also developed including a Business card, Letterhead and Compliment slip. In addition a A3 Poster was also developed
                       to promote the opening of the cafe shop.</p>
                       <p>When visiting the National Museum a number of elements and designs stood out to me that could potentially be used in the design piece for a logo.  In particular I found the early Celtic symbols and monuments to be of interest to me so I wanted to incorporate these into my design. I took photographs of interesting monuments and artifacts and created sketches as I moved through the museum.  Brainstorming ideas in my sketchbook I focused on these Celtic themes. I wrote out the Ogham language and experimented with using the lettering somewhere in the design of a logo, I sketched designs such as snakes and ribbon patterns based on Viking and Celtic artwork and I also tried drawing crosses and circular patterns. During this exploratory phase I noticed the spirals that were carved into the monument at Newgrange that symbolise the sun and researching the monument I discovered that it was built to capture the rising sun during the spring equinox when the sun would illuminate the passageway of the monument. 
The idea of using ‘Equinox’ as the name of the café came to mind and researching symbolic meaning behind the equinox I discovered that it represented a time of renewal and rebirth and of reconnecting with the world and feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. These feelings also overlap with the benefits and reasons of why people drink fruit juice and coffee so the name seemed very suitable to use for a café logo. Once I had decided the name for the café I began idea generation in my sketchbook writing out the word ‘Equinox’ to see what symbols could be used. The spiral circle was used initially in the design in place of the letter ‘e’ and I experimented with incorporating the spiral in different ways into the logo design. I also researched the word equinox online to see if there were any existing logos or companies using the name. There are some companies currently using the name equinox in their branding and the lunar eclipse is used within some of the existing logos that I found. I wanted to also incorporate the eclipse image into my logo idea so began experimenting with this. During this experimentation phase I rotated the spiral circle to use it within the logo name in place of the letter ‘q’ which I think worked well. I wanted to tie in the theme of a café into the logo so the idea of using a coffee cup came to mind. I then identified three final ideas from my designs that I wanted to explore in greater detail. The final idea I chose uses the coffee cup symbol in place of the letter ‘o’ in the wording of the logo so the final logo now had elements of the spring equinox and also the theme of coffee represented. 
</p>
                       
                     <u><h3>Development of Logo and Branding material using Adobe Illustrator:</h3></u>
                    <p>Once I had the final design I began experimenting with colour. I felt that the colour needed to represent the spring sun while also representing coffee. I created a gradient using orange and yellow to represent the sun and this colour scheme worked well as the warm colours are inviting and would attract someone’s attention who was in need of warming and refreshing themselves by buying a coffee. The warm orange colour is also suitable as it triggers the idea of a refreshing breakfast buying an orange juice to drink before you face the challenges of a new day. The rest of the logo lettering is in a brown colour to reinforce the café subject and this colour is also associated with the earth so fits in well with the overall theme of the design. </p>
